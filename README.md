In summary, the code is importing various functions from a module file named functions.js, and then it calls and prints the results of these functions with specific arguments. Here's the flow:

Import all functions from functions.js into an object named myModule.
Call welcomeMessage with the string "ANUJ".
Assign distanceConverter to a constant and call it with 10.
Assign square to a constant and call it with 4, 16, and 10.
Call advancedFunction with the cube function and the number 10.
This code structure makes it easy to manage and call multiple functions from a single module.
